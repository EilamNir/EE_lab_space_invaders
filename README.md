# EE_lab_space_invaders

## TODO list

- fill TODO list with project goals and steps
- change appropriate parameters to constants
- create a package for types, and change appropriate parameters to types
- consider changing the player movement to only start gradually (with a fast acceleration)
- understand what is the meaning of everything in DE10_standard_Audio.sdc and choose what to enable there
- change the movement to be 4-up 2-left 5-down 8-right enter-shoot, to make every needed key combination work (currently the combination of shoot-left-down or 0-4-5 does not work, because of a hardware limitation of the keyboard)
